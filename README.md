# CS1660-Final-Project
Here is the actual files for the project. Sadly, I could not manage to navigate the documentation for AWS properly to make this program run. As such, I have two videos, one showing the GUI Program and how it works, and the other talking through the code. I did get the program to upload to docker, after some minor issues with it not recognizing the jar for many of the aws commands I needed. As for running, idealy you should run the python file first to establish the database, then you can then compile the program after replacing the aws credentials in both the AmazonStorage and DB.py, and it will run what exists. Also to note, it is ran from GUIProgram.java.
